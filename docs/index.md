# Knowledge Graph Toolkit (KGTK)

KGTK is a Python library for easy manipulation with knowledge graphs. It provides a flexible framework that allows chaining of common graph operations, such as: extraction of subgraphs, filtering, computation of graph metrics, validation, cleaning, generating embeddings, and so on. Its principal format is TSV, though we do support a number of other inputs.
